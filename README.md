JiraClient
==========

STATUS: Alpha


JiraClient is a python client for Jira's REST API (version 2). This is a work in progress to replace a client I wrote for their older APIs.     


USE:
If you want to try the code as-is, set three environment variables (JIRA_API_USER, JIRA_API_PASS, JIRA_API_URL) then take a look at scratchpad.py for a few examples  
The code here does work, and over the next few days will be prettied up and missing functionality added.
